# NestJS E-Commerce API

A comprehensive and robust RESTful API for a full-featured e-commerce platform, built as a study project to explore and implement advanced backend concepts using the NestJS ecosystem.

## üìñ About The Project

This API serves as the complete backend for an e-commerce application. It includes essential features like secure user authentication with JWT, a complete product catalog with advanced search and filtering, a transactional order management system, and much more.

While the core functionalities are robust and complete, the project is designed as a foundational boilerplate. It can be extended with additional complementary features and is not intended for production use without further hardening and specific configurations (like using a cloud storage service instead of local storage).

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Authentication & Security:**
  - System for login with **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).
  - Complete **"Forgot Password"** flow with secure, expiring, and hashed reset tokens. The token generation and reset logic is fully functional, but the email dispatch is currently **simulated** by logging the token to the console. Integration with an email service (like SendGrid, Mailgun) is required for production.
  - **Password Change** functionality for logged-in users.
  - Password hashing with `bcrypt`.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** using custom decorators (`@Roles`) to protect routes for `USER` and `ADMIN` roles.

- **User Management:**
  - User registration, with the **first registered user automatically becoming an `ADMIN`**.
  - Endpoints for authenticated users to manage their own profile (`/users/me`).
  - Admin-exclusive endpoints for listing, searching, and managing all users.
  - Secure data handling, ensuring password hashes are never exposed in API responses.

- **Product Catalog:**
  - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products, restricted to `ADMIN` users.
  - A powerful public-facing `GET /products` endpoint with:
    - Text-based search across multiple fields (name, description, slug).
    - Advanced filtering by `categoryId`, price range, etc.
    - Dynamic and secure sorting by whitelisted fields (`name`, `currentPrice`, `createdAt`).
  - Dynamic data views, showing extended details for `ADMIN`s and a curated public view for customers.
  - **Image Uploads** for products, supporting multiple files with validation. The current implementation uses **local file storage**, which is suitable for development. The service can be easily adapted to use a cloud storage service like **Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a CDN** for a production environment.
  - **Soft-delete** pattern via product status changes (`ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `ARCHIVED`).

- **Categories & Addresses:**
  - Full CRUD for product categories and user addresses.
  - Automatic `slug` generation for categories for user-friendly URLs.
  - **Real-time CEP (Brazilian Zip Code) validation** using an external API, implemented as a custom `class-validator` decorator.
  - Transactional logic to ensure a user can only have **one primary address**.

- **Order Management:**
  - **Transactional order creation** using `prisma.$transaction` to guarantee data integrity (stock is checked and updated atomically with order creation).
  - **Finite State Machine** for order statuses (`PENDING`, `PAID`, `SHIPPED`, etc.) with validated transitions.
  - Secure endpoints for users to view and **cancel their own orders** based on business rules.
  - Comprehensive admin endpoints for managing all orders.

- **Architecture & Code Quality:**
  - Modular design with clear separation of concerns.
  - Reusable, generic **pagination utility** to provide consistent responses across all list endpoints.
  - Extensive use of DTOs and `class-validator` for robust request validation.
  - Clean and consistent error handling using NestJS built-in exceptions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (recommended for easy setup)

### Installation & Setup

#### üê≥ Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose, which will set up both the API and PostgreSQL database automatically.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Start the development environment:**

    ```bash
    ./docker.sh dev
    ```

    Or manually:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
    ```

3.  **The API will be ready at:** `http://localhost:3000`

The Docker setup automatically handles:

- PostgreSQL database setup
- Database migrations
- Prisma client generation
- Hot reloading for development

#### üîß Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    - Add the necessary variables based on the example below.

    **_.env.example_**

    ```env
    # URL for the PostgreSQL database connection, preferably running in Docker
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname?schema=public"

    # Secret key for signing JWTs. Use a strong, randomly generated string.
    JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_STRONG_SECRET_KEY"

    # --- For a Production Email Service (Optional) ---
    # EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
    # EMAIL_PORT=587
    # EMAIL_USER=user@example.com
    # EMAIL_PASS=password
    ```

4.  **Start the Database with Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres-ecommerce \
      -e POSTGRES_DB=ecommerce \
      -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
      -p 5432:5432 \
      -d postgres:15-alpine
    ```

5.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    - This command will create the tables and types in your database based on the `schema.prisma` file.
      ```bash
      npx prisma migrate dev
      ```

6.  **Seed the Database:**
    - This command executes the `prisma/seed.ts` script to populate the database with sample data.
      ```bash
      npx prisma db seed
      ```
